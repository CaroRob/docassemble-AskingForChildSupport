id: Interim child support order
question: |
  Interim child support order
subquestion: |
  When parents do not live together, child support is money one parent gives the other parent to help pay for their children’s expenses.
  
  The judge will sign a child support order at the end of your case, and pick the date the child support should start.  Sometimes the start date is in the past, and one parent owes the other parent back child support.
  
    If you do not want to wait until the end of your case, you can ask the judge for an “interim” child support order that starts before the case ends.  
   
fields:
  - "What do you want to do?": interim_motion
    input type: radio
    choices:
      - "Wait for the judge to order child support at the end of my case.": wait
      - "Ask the judge to order child support while my case is going on": ask 
  - note: |
      #### <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Learn more ####
      An interim order is any order the judge makes before they make the final order or decree. 
      The judge can make short-term decisions about child support, the parenting plan, 
      % if (existing_case == 'open' and user_role_in_case == 'defendant' and need_to_respond) or (existing_case == 'unknown' and after_courtview == 'open' and user_role_in_case == 'defendant' and need_to_respond): 
        % if case_type in('divorce', 'dissolution', 'legal separation'):
       possession of the family home, spousal support or payment of debts, 
        % endif
      % elif existing_case == 'none' or (existing_case == 'unknown' and after_courtview == 'none'):
        % if parents_married:
       possession of the family home, spousal support or payment of debts, 
        % endif
      % endif
      and attorney fees. The final order may be entirely different.

  You probably filled out child support forms to start your case. 
  They can be complicated to fill out.
  You may have to update them during your case or if you have a trial.

  How many children will your child support order cover? 
fields:
  - no label: number_of_children

      - "1 child": one
      - "More than 1 child": more than one
  - note: |
      #### <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Learn more ####
      
      Child support orders last until your children turn 18, or last until they turn 19 if:
      
      1. They still live with you or their other parent, and
      2. They are finishing high school.

id: Paternity
question: |
  Paternity
subquestion: |
 Paternity refers to a child’s legal father.  Only a child’s legal father has the rights and responsibilities of a father.  Usually a child’s biological father is also their legal father.
 
 You may have to prove the identity of your child’s biological father to establish him as the legal father if you and the other parent disagree.

  * Proving someone is the **biological** father of a child is called "establishing paternity."
  * Proving someone is not the **biological** father is called "disestablishing paternity." 

  Do you want to add information about establishing or disestablishing paternity to your Personal Action Plan?
fields:
  - no label: paternity
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - note: |
      #### <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Learn more ####
      It can be complicated if your child is not the biological child of both parents.  You may want to talk to a lawyer if you have questions about establishing or disestablishing paternity and:
      
      *	your child is adopted, 
      *	you and the other parent are the same gender,
      *	you and the other parent are transgender parents, or
      * your child was conceived by in vitro fertilization, or surrogacy.

id: Ask CSED or the Court for a child support order
question: |
  Do you want to ask the court or CSED to order a child support?
subquestion: |
  % if paternity:
  Your action plan includes information about "establishing paternity" and "disestablishing paternity."
  % endif
  
  A child support order tells one parent to pay child support to the other parent.
  
  **The Alaska Court** orders child support as part of a Parenting Plan in divorce, custody, dissolution or legal separation cases.  Parenting Plans are sometimes called “custody orders”.  
  A Parenting Plan is a list of decisions about:
  
  *	which parent pays child support, 
  *	the amount of child support
  *	a schedule for when and how long your children will stay at each parent’s house, 
  *	a holiday schedule,
  *	how you will make decisions about your children, and 
  *	financial questions like: 
    *	spending your children’s PFD, or 
    *	claiming child tax credits.  
  
  **The Alaska Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED)** can order child support but does not order Parenting Plans. CSED child support orders work best if you do not need a Parenting Plan.  
  
fields: 
  - "I want to learn how to ask for child support from:": ask_court_or_cssd
    label above field: True
    input type: radio
    choices:

      - "CSED": cssd
      - "Both": both
  - note: |
      #### <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Learn more####
      The Alaska Supreme Court sets the formula that judges and Alaska Child Support Enforcement Division must follow when they decide the amount of child support payments.

  Your Personal Action Plan includes information about how to ask the Alaska Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED) for a child support order. 
  % endif
  
  If you want the court to order child support, you must start a court case.
  
  If you are not married to the other parent, start a custody case to get a Parenting Plan and child support.
  
  If you are married to the other parent, start a divorce, dissolution, or legal separation case.
